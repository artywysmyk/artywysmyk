# Hello World, I’m @artywysmyk!
- I'm originaly from Poland. I lived in London for 5 years. Currently I'm based in South of France. 
- I have a MA degree in Art History and hence not sursprisingly most of my working experience to date comes from the arts, culture and heritage sector. However, in early 2021 I decided to completely change my career and embarked on a new journey that is learning how to code and become a Front End Developer.
- I'm currently doing Udemy's web development course, [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele. So far I've learnt the following technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, **SASS**, **JavaScript**, **Responsive Design**, **AJAX and Single Page Apps**, **Bootstrap**, **Unix(Command Line) Commands**, **NodeJS**, **NPM**. 
- I built 15 [Vanilla JavaScript Projects](https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/) (tutorials by John Smilga).  
- I'm currently learning Git, Github, [CSS Framework (React)](https://react-projects.netlify.app/), doing Frontend Mentor Challenges and finishing Udemy's web development bootcamp. 
- I love photography, fashion, design, travelling, reading, going to museums, learning new skills and of course coding!
